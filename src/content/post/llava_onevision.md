## Overview

We present **LLaVA-OneVision**, a family of open large multimodal models (LMMs) developed by consolidating our insights into data, models, and visual representations in the LLaVA-NeXT blog series. LLaVA-OneVision is the **first single model** that can simultaneously push the performance boundaries of open LMMs in three important computer vision scenarios: **single-image**, **multi-image**, and **video** scenarios.

## Key Features

### Unified Architecture
LLaVA-OneVision is designed to have a similar maximum visual token count across different scenarios, enabling flexible extension to multiple visual signal types while maintaining consistent performance.

### Model Sizes
- **0.5B parameters** - Lightweight deployment
- **7B parameters** - Balanced performance
- **72B parameters** - State-of-the-art capabilities

## Emerging Capabilities

The design of LLaVA-OneVision enables strong transfer learning across different modalities and scenarios, yielding impressive emerging capabilities:

### 1. Cross-Scenario Understanding
Seamlessly process and understand content across single images, multiple images, and videos within a unified framework.

### 2. Advanced Visual Analysis
- **Diagram and table interpretation** - Understanding complex visual structures
- **Multi-screenshot interaction** - Analyzing relationships across multiple screens
- **Set-of-mark object referencing** - Precise object identification and tracking

### 3. Video Capabilities
- **Image-to-video generation understanding** - Comprehending temporal transitions
- **Video analysis and comparison** - Deep understanding of video content
- **Multi-camera video interpretation** - Processing footage from multiple viewpoints
- **Detailed video subject description** - Rich, contextual video narration

## Strong Transfer Learning

Importantly, the design of LLaVA-OneVision allows strong transfer learning across different modalities/scenarios. In particular, strong video understanding and cross-scenario capabilities are demonstrated through task transfer from images to videos, showcasing the model's ability to generalize learned representations across visual domains.
